# OitCodingChallenge
#OIT coding challenge from BYU 2024

Start of the project is going to be 5:45 PM MST
I'm very excited to show off what I can do

Finished psydocode at 6:26. Going to start the initial design refer to notebook for design notes. Going to design the classes next.

Dependancies needed include the "random module" and the "Prettier Extension"

## **Final Thoughts on the Project**

This project was really fun because I was able to follow my psydocode pretty accurately.
The Main struggle I found was trying to complete the project under four hours. It took me about 6 Hours to get everything sorted correctly. I did have a couple set backs with my coding environment being messed up.
I had to re-download python and fix my python linter.

I finished all of the project expect for the Tie game part. However, If I had 15 minutes more I think I could do it.

Thanks for the Project I had a great Time

### Total Time Spent **6 hours**
